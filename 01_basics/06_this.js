// 16‚úÖ How to Explain ‚Äúthis‚Äù 
// ‚ÄúIn JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. 
// The value of this depends on how the function is called, not where it is defined. 
// It can point to different things in different contexts:

// In a regular function, this refers to the global object (window in the browser), or undefined in strict mode.
// In an object method, this refers to the object itself.
// In a class method, this refers to the class instance, unless it's detached.
// In an arrow function, this doesn‚Äôt have its own binding ‚Äî it inherits this from its lexical (parent) scope.


const user2 = {
  name: "Pranav",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello " + this.name);
  }
};
user2.greet();                                   // Output: Hello Pranav
